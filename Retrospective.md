## Learning

I learned a lot about multithreaded programs.  More specificaly how to lock/unlock and broadcast to make things work

## Known issues or Bugs

The program currently segfaults.  I am not entirly sure why this is happening but I think with a few more days I could get this to work.

## Sources used

Class notes and the textbook.
